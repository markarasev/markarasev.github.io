# Hello, I'm Marc 👋

I'm a **senior software engineer**, focusing on building high-quality, extendable and scalable backend applications. I write code for **humans first**, and eventually for machines.

I am a specialist of the **Scala** programming language and the **JVM** ecosystem, but first and foremost I'm a specialist of **software development**. So I don't mind using other programming ecosystems, with a marked preference for advanced ones.

I'm also involved in programming communities such as the organization of the [Scala.io](https://scala.io/) conference at which I had the opportunity to [speak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtY8b4AEx1Y).

## What I do ☕️

- **Understand** and analyze your business problem (sometimes the best thing to do may be nothing)
- **Design** solutions
- **Build** them
- **Mentor** and help other people with software development and programming
- **Help** your company design its global software system

## What I'm looking for 👥

 - &nbsp; Real **team work** (not working in individual silos) / **extreme programming**
 - &nbsp; High throughput / scaling **challenges**
 - &nbsp; **People** to mentor
 - &nbsp; People able to **mentor me**
 - &nbsp; **Tech culture**
 - &nbsp; **Purpose** (unfortunately it is hard to come-up here with a concrete list of meaningful subjects to me)
 {: style='list-style-type: "\2705"'}

If your project meets some of the above criteria, please email-me at [hello@markarasev.me](mailto:hello@markarasev.me)

## Terms 🤝

I live in the far-west of France 🇫🇷 namely "Finistère" (literally "end-of-the-earth" in French), so **remote-work** is essential to me.

Also, I'd like to work part-time on a **4 days a week** basis.

During this journey, I was deeply involved in designing and building Quansic's software system to make it **grow from a proof of concept to an ecosystem of products** with real-time integrations. I also enjoyed sharing knowledge and training new teammates.

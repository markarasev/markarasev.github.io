# Hello, I'm Marc 👋

I'm a **senior software engineer** dedicated to building high-quality, extendable and scalable backend applications. I write code for **humans first**, and eventually for machines.

I am a specialist of the **Scala** programming language and the **JVM** ecosystem, but first and foremost I'm a specialist of **software development**. So I don't mind using other programming ecosystems, with a marked preference for advanced ones.

I'm also involved in programming communities such as the organization of the [Scala.io](https://scala.io/) conference at which I had the opportunity to [speak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtY8b4AEx1Y).

## What I do ☕️

- **Understand** and analyze your business problem
- **Design** solutions
- **Build** them
- **Mentor** and assist others with software development and programming
- **Help** your company design its global software system

## What I'm looking for 👥

 - Real **team work** (not working in individual silos) / **extreme programming**
 - High throughput / scaling **challenges**
 - **People** to mentor
 - People able to **mentor me**
 - A strong **tech culture**
 - **Purpose** (though it’s hard to list all meaningful subjects here)
 {: class='checklist'}

If your project meets some of the above criteria, please email-me at [hello@markarasev.me](mailto:hello@markarasev.me)

## Terms 🤝

I live in the far-west of France 🇫🇷 in a region named "Finistère" (literally "end-of-the-earth" in French), so **remote-work** is essential to me.

Additionally, I would prefer to work part-time on a **4 days workweek** basis.

## Experience 👨‍💻

### **Technical Lead** • Quansic • *2020 - 2024*

I was part of [Quansic](https://quansic.com/), a music industry startup, from its early days to its [buyout by Luminate](https://luminatedata.com/blog/quansic-aquisition-press-release/), a preeminent entertainment data company. During this journey, I was deeply involved in designing and building Quansic's software system, **evolving it from a proof of concept to a robust ecosystem of products**. I also enjoyed sharing knowledge and training new teammates.
